# Chat-Application

## Introduction
This repository contains a chatbot application created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, and the React framework. The chatbot allows users to register, log in, and engage in chat conversations with other contacts. The application utilizes a client-server architecture, with the server running on port 50000 and storing data in a MongoDB database. The static files for the React application are served by the server itself.

## Description
The Chat-Application is a web-based chatbot that provides a user-friendly interface for seamless communication. It offers the following features:

ðŸ’¥ <b> Login Page: </b>Users can authenticate themselves by entering their credentials.

ðŸ’¥ <b> Registration Page: </b> New users can create an account by providing the necessary details.

ðŸ’¥ <b> Chat Page: </b>  Once logged in, users can view their contacts and engage in real-time chat conversations.

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with JavaScript for interactive functionality. React is utilized as the frontend framework for building reusable UI components. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing the server-side logic and API endpoints. MongoDB serves as the database for storing user information and chat data. The server also serves the static files for the React application, eliminating the need for a separate build step
